                    Hi, my name is Lolu. Welcome to my Portfolio! <br></br>My journey into web3 began early winter of 2017 when I cluelessly bought bitcoin
                    and forgot about it. I later remembered in 2021 and converted it to fiat. This opened my eyes to a store of value that was completely new to me. It made me curious.
                    So I researched about the type of internet architecture that kept it secure and running, and found Blockchain in the middle of it all.
                    This led me down this web3 rabbit hole.
                    <p>
                       Over the past year, I have taken the traditional route of learning web2 technology stack intensively before diving into web3, so as to lay a solid foundation for the 
                       strucure of knowledge I will subsequently acquire about this evergrowing space.
